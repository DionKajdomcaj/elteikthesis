\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:sum}

Knowing that \textbf{Mastodon} is evolving day by day, and many officials are starting to use it, I think that a software
like \textbf{Mastodon Social Media Threat Alert} is needed to ensure safety for the users, and to make the users feel more
comfortable while using it, especially when it comes to organization servers, that are a target for scammers, fake profiles etc.
It will even increase \textbf{Mastodon} users, since there is still no social media guaranteeing you that it filters the fake profiles
from the real ones, and in case of organizations, this is very important since they know exactly what are they dealing with.
I truly believe that with the right team the project is going to have a very promising future.

The way I think this software can improve is to be integrated in every new server that opens up, so that the users don't
need to run it at all, but everything should run internally on the server they are registered in.
Another improvement point is the model, where I think it can be even more accurate if we train it with a very large dataset from
different servers, which I couldn't do since I had limited access, but the \textbf{Mastodon} itself could invest in training the
model that way, and making it learn continuously, so that the accuracy could reach a percentage at least 95.
Even the features could be extended like reporting an account to the server admin so he/she can inspect it manually and even ban the
account ip from the server, if he/she thinks that it is a fake account.

I truly believe that this software is very valuable and needs to be implemented not only in \textbf{Mastodon}, but even in
other open source social medias, or even other open source software that require accounts in order to use them.
