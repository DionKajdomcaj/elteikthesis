\section{Motivation}
Nowadays we all know someone who has been affected negatively
by the bullying happening on social media, which is becoming
a very common problem in our society. Sometimes those cases
escalated to the point where it turned into a serious mental
health problem for the ones who have been affected. I was
always wondering for a way to help people prevent similar
cases and feel safe while surfing the social media feed.
Everyone has it's rights to feel safe while doing a certain
activity, but bringing safety to the social media in these
kind of cases has been neglected throughout these last years.

The main reasons mentioned above have pushed me to brainstorm
an idea to help people feel safe on Mastodon, which is an open source social media,
and enjoy the beauty of connecting with real profiles and use the
social media to the point where it changes their life for good.
